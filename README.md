# Microcontroller-Based-Plant-Hydrator-Using-Weather-Prediction-and-Soil-Analysis
Watering the plants is labor intensive work. It is very important to control the amount of water that reaches the plants whatever the weather it is. Ground water level is declining day by day due to unplanned use of water. So water shortage is also a problem nowadays. Sometimes farmers turn on the motor and then forget to switch it off due to negligence of work, which causes water wastage. It also happens that sometimes they forget to give water which causes damage to crops. So proper use of water is very important. Our project can overcome this problem. This project is based on an Arduino microcontroller. A soil moisture sensor is used to sense the moisture level of the soil. Then it will send a signal based on it. Relay is like a switch. It is used to handle the distribution of larger power based on low power signals. Temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature of the environment. We have included more proper instruments to create a system that can measure soil moisture and temperature using Arduino. The aim of our project is to develop a plant hydrator system which measures the moisture of the soil and temperature. Then it automatically turns on or off the water supply system.
